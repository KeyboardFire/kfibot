# kfibot

An IRC bot with a flexible learn database, written in Ruby with the Cinch
framework.

Dependencies:

    sudo gem install cinch
    sudo gem install cinch-identify

If you want the `!js` command to work, you also need:

    sudo npm install -g sandbox

Edit the file `config.example.rb` and rename it to `config.rb` to get started.
